          Evening, Hailey! <br>

    <p><span style="font-family: Lucida Console;"><span style="color: #59e077;">Unfortunately,
          we cannot accept your application to make your base a licensed
          and registered research facility under PSI's name, as it is deemed too
          primitive by
          our standards, as well as violates a few of our rules and regulations
          (See Article
          C1, and D3, as well as our Spread Prevention Protocol). As soon as you
          have
          amended the small issues here and there, we will send you the
          equipment
          requested, and your Facility will be considered a registered PSI
          Research Facility.
          Please, take some time to fix any breaches of protocol before sending
          us another
          E-mail.</span></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Lucida Console;"><span style="color: #59e077;">
          Thank you for reaching out to us, and have a wonderful night, <br>
        </span></span></p>
